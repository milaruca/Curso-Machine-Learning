In this folder I have included 2 sets of exercises:
Variables such as Primitives (integers, floats, strings, booleans, and more)  - Condicionals structures (diagrams, palindrome)
More exercises done in the Machine Learning course given by Luis Sastre an amazing teacher who knows how to explain in a way that is easy to understand. In this course we have worked with Pandas, Bucles and Data collection. 
Work with Pandas dataframe, train a model with Prophet and generate interactive maps with Folium.
